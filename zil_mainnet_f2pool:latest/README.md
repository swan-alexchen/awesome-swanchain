Zilliqa is a blockchain that enables and scales decentralized apps, from financial services to NFT marketplaces. It uses Proof of Work mining for Sybil resistance and Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance for consensus, and is commonly dual-mined with ETC.

f2pool’s Zilliqa pool is currently dual-mined with Ethereum Classic. Due to the nature of Zilliqa’s mining mechanism, you may mine 1 minute of ZIL every 1 to 2 hours, and use your hashrate for ETC mining for the rest of the time.

Zilliqa supports GPUs and ASICs. Some available ASICs including ForestMiner, iPollo, and so on, while Jasminer, YAMI are currently not available.

To get more familiar with Zilliqa, feel free to check out the official website and block explorer. You can also find a summary of Zilliqa metrics and other resources on our Zilliqa page.
