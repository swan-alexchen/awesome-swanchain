Aleo is a new layer-1 blockchain platform for creating scalable and private applications applying zero-knowledge cryptography. Aleo uses a hybrid consensus architecture named AleoBFT, which leverages PoS to achieve instant finality for block confirmation, and leverages PoW “coinbase puzzle” that rewards the development of faster techniques for proof generation.
